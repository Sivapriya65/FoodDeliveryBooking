# FoodDeliveryBooking

Java programing

A food delivery company has 'n' number of delivery executives. For simplicity take the count as 5 but the program
should work for any number of delivery executives (Let their names be identified as DE1, DE2....DE-n)
There are only 5 restaurants in the city for pick-up and 5 drop locations (Each location can have multiple customers) 
After delivering a food package , the delivery executive waits there for delivery allotment.
